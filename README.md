# Indulgence

This is a web application is to help anyone realize whether a habit is going to make you more content, or if it causes discontentment in your life.

This uses MVC as the base layout and handlebars for the HTML. Also uses Node.js/Express/MongoDB with Google OAuth for authentication, and adding in a local passport option for a non-google login.

Some features I will be adding along the way will be individual sections for contentment vs discontentment pages, easy to read buttons, better backgrounds, and color groupings.

# Usage
Add your mongoDB URI and Google OAuth credentials to the config.env file

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development
npm run dev

# Run in production
npm start
```
